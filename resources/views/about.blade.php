    <h2>Naelon George</h2>
    <p>Web development became my canvas to bring ideas to life. Whether it's crafting sleek, user-friendly websites or experimenting with new frameworks, you love the challenge of making something functional and beautiful at the same time. Each line of code feels like a step toward solving a puzzle, and when things click into place, it is incredibly satisfying. From the logic of backend code to the creativity of frontend design, I am driven by the constant learning that comes with the ever-evolving world of web development.</p>
